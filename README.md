# forge-mapsaver

A very simple mapart saver for Forge 1.12.2

Middle-click on a map to export it as an image into the "mapsaver" folder. This also works with multi-map maparts although this is experimental and results may vary. Edit the config.cfg file to adjust merging threshold and search range.

This is my first ever forge mod so I'm aware the code is really bad. If you feel like tidying it up or adding more features then feel free to make a PR or contact me.
