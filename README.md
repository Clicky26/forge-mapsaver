# forge-mapsaver

A very simple mapart saver for Forge 1.12.2

When a map is rendered by the client, it's grabbed by the mod and exported into a png file in the "mapsaver" folder.

This is my first ever forge mod so I'm aware the code is really bad. If you feel like tidying it up or adding more features then feel free to make a PR or contact me.
